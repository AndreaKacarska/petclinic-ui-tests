## Setup

### Tools & Requirements
Make sure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- JDK 21 - Required to build and run the tests
- Maven - Required for dependency management and test execution
- IntelliJ IDEA - Recommended for development and running tests
- Git - Required to clone, update and contribute to the project code
- Google Chrome - Required for running the UI tests in the Chrome browser (used by Selenium WebDriver)

### Clone the PetClinic UI TEST project
You are likely reading this from GitHub. To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndreaKacarska/petclinic-ui-tests.git
```

### Clone the PetClinic Angular frontend project
Before running the test project: 
* First, start the backend (spring-petclinic-rest project) locally
* Then, start the frontend (spring-petclinic-angular project) locally. 
  * NOTE: Do not run the applications using Docker. The UI tests require both the frontend and backend to be running locally.

#### Steps to clone and run the spring-petclinic-angular project locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular.git
```
* Follow the README steps of the spring-petclinic-angular project to start the Angular frontend application locally.

### Running tests locally
Once everything is set up and the frontend and backend are running locally, you can run the UI tests.
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and add a Maven configuration [clean, test]
- Run the configuration to execute all the tests
